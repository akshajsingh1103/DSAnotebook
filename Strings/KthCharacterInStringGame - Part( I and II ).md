## 🎯 Short Answer (intuition first):

When you go to the second half at any depth, you're not jumping from `'a'` directly to `'c'` or `'d'` or something wild.  
You're always shifting **relative to where you are right now**.

So if you're at depth 3 and currently at `'a'`, and you decide to go into the second half:

- You're not jumping ahead 2 levels in shift.  
- You're just going one level down into the second half of the structure built from `'a'`.

And in this recursive structure, the second half is always made from:

```
build(depth - 1, shift(current_char))
```

So every shift is `+1`, not `+2` or `+3`.  
It’s not based on *how deep* you are — it’s based on the fact that:

> “I’m currently standing at node `'c'` at depth D, and I’m going into the right (second) half of `build(D, c)`. That half is always built from `shift(c)`.”

---

## 🧱 Brick-by-brick Explanation

Let’s break it with a real-world analogy and structure.

### 🎲 Rule of string growth (again):

```
build(depth, c) = build(depth - 1, c) + build(depth - 1, shift(c))
```

It’s like a tree where:

```
         build(3, 'a')
        /             \
  build(2, 'a')     build(2, 'b')
   /       \         /        \
b(1,'a') b(1,'b') b(1,'b') b(1,'c')
```

Each time you go to the second half, you shift just once.  
You never “stack” shifts because you don’t teleport from the top to bottom in one step.

You walk:

- From `build(3, 'a')` to  
- `build(2, 'b')` to  
- `build(1, 'c')` to  
- `build(0, 'd')`

So your letter becomes `'a'` → `'b'` → `'c'` → `'d'`, one shift at each step — but only if you go right each time.

Each shift happens because of a **local decision** at that level:

> “Oh, I’m in the second half? That’s built from `shift(current_char)`.”

---

## ✅ Example — Dry run of `func(7, 3, 'a')`

Let's simulate this call:

```
build(3, 'a') = build(2, 'a') + build(2, 'b')
             = abbc + bccd
Indexes:       1 2 3 4   5 6 7 8
```

We want the **7th character** → it's `'c'`

Let’s trace what `func(7, 3, 'a')` does:

### Level 3:
- `half = 2^(3 - 1) = 4`
- 7 > 4 → go to second half
- Shift `'a'` → `'b'`
- `k = 7 - 4 = 3`
→ Now call: `func(3, 2, 'b')`

### Level 2:
- `half = 2^(2 - 1) = 2`
- 3 > 2 → second half
- Shift `'b'` → `'c'`
- `k = 3 - 2 = 1`
→ Now call: `func(1, 1, 'c')`

### Level 1:
- `half = 1`
- 1 ≤ 1 → first half
→ Stay with `'c'`, call `func(1, 0, 'c')`

→ return `'c'`

✅ Final answer: `'c'` — just like we saw from the built string.

---

## 🧁 Bottom Line (your main question):

### ❓ “If I'm at depth 3 and came from `'a'`, how do I know to shift only once?”

✅ Because you're not "at depth 3 jumping 3 shifts ahead".  
You're **walking down one level at a time**, and at each level, you ask:

> “Am I in the first or second half?”

If you're in the:

- **First half** → stay at current letter  
- **Second half** → shift letter by +1

And this happens at each step, recursively.  
So if you went into the second half 3 times, you’d shift `'a'` → `'b'` → `'c'` → `'d'`.

But that’s just the result of shifting by `+1` three times — not a single `+3` jump.

---

## 🎯 So we’re sure we shift to `'b'` (not `'c'`) because:

- At that moment, we’re at letter `'a'`  
- And we’re only stepping **one level down**  
- Second half = `build(depth - 1, shift(c))` → always just `+1` shift from current

---

## 🪵 You said:

```
build(3, 'a')
    /       \
build(2, 'a') build(2, 'b')
   /   \        /      \
b(1,'a') b(1,'b') b(1,'b') b(1,'c')
```

---

## ❓ Where's depth 0 in this?

Great catch — and this shows your attention to detail is on point.

You're asking:

> “In the tree diagram you gave for `build(3, 'a')`, I saw levels like `build(2, 'a')`, `build(1, 'b')`, etc...  
But where is **depth 0**? Isn’t that the base case of the recursion? Why didn’t it show up in the diagram?”

Let’s walk through that and **add depth 0** to the picture so it's crystal clear. 🧼

---

## 🧠 First, understand how the `build()` function is structured:

```
build(depth, c) = 
    if (depth == 0) return string(1, c); 
    else return build(depth - 1, c) + shift_all(build(depth - 1, c));
```

So `depth = 0` is the **base case** — just return the letter `'c'`.

---

## 🌳 Tree of `build(3, 'a')` (WITH depth 0 nodes added):

Here’s the **full recursion tree** now including depth = 0 leaves:

```
                      build(3, 'a')                     ← depth 3
                     /             \
            build(2, 'a')        build(2, 'b')          ← depth 2
             /       \            /        \
      build(1, 'a') build(1, 'b') build(1, 'b') build(1, 'c')  ← depth 1
        /   \         /   \         /   \         /   \
 b(0,'a') b(0,'b') b(0,'b') b(0,'c') b(0,'b') b(0,'c') b(0,'c') b(0,'d')  ← depth 0
```

So yes — **depth 0 is the leaf layer**.  
Each of those returns a **single character**, like `'a'`, `'b'`, `'c'`, `'d'`.

---

## 🧪 Let’s trace one full path to a depth-0 node:

Take the leftmost leaf:  
It comes from this chain of calls:

```
build(3, 'a') →
  build(2, 'a') →
    build(1, 'a') →
      build(0, 'a') → returns "a"
```

✅ That’s the **first character** of the final string — the `'a'`.

---

## 🧁 So why didn’t depth 0 show up earlier?

Because:

- When drawing trees like this, we often skip **terminal leaves** to keep the diagram simpler  
- But now that you’re asking about the full recursion, it’s important to **show them too**

Each `build(0, c)` call returns a **1-letter string** — it's the literal letter you see in the final result.

---


## ✅ More Doubts

### ❓ Is reaching depth 0 our only goal?

Yes — that’s the **base case** of the recursion. Once we hit it, we return the final character.  
You **don’t need to go deeper** or do any further processing.  

### ❓ Are we guaranteed to end up with a single character there?

**Absolutely.**  
Every level you go down, you reduce the string to either the left or right half.  
Eventually, you’re left with just one character — that’s your **k-th character** in the fully built virtual string.

## Code Part-I

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    char func(int k, int depth , char c){
        if(depth==0) return c ;

        int half = 1<<(depth -1);

        if(k<=half){
            return func(k, depth-1, c);
        }else{
            char new_c = (c - 'a' + 1) % 26 + 'a';
;
            return func(k-half, depth-1, new_c);
        }
    }
    char kthCharacter(int k) {
        int depth = 0;
        while(1<<(depth)<k){
            depth+=1 ;
        }return func(k,depth, 'a');
    }
};
```

# 🧠 Part 2: Modified Logic for `operations[]`

Now we support different operations at each depth:
- Each level may do either:
  - `0` (double word)
  - `1` (append shifted version)

### New Function Signature:
```cpp
char func(int k, int depth, char c, vector<int>& operations)
```

### New Logic:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    char func(long long k, int depth, char c, const vector<int>& ops) {
        if (depth == 0) return c;

        long long half = 1LL << (depth - 1);
        if (k <= half) {
            return func(k, depth - 1, c, ops);
        } else {
            char new_c = ops[depth - 1] == 1 ? (c - 'a' + 1) % 26 + 'a' : c;
            return func(k - half, depth - 1, new_c, ops);
        }
    }

    char kthCharacter(long long k, vector<int>& operations) {
        int depth = 0;
        while ((1LL << depth) < k) depth++;
        return func(k, depth, 'a', operations);
    }
};

```

---

## ✅ Why This Works:

At each level:
- First half always comes from `build(d-1, c)`
- Second half comes from:
  - Same `c` if `operation == 0`
  - Shifted `c` if `operation == 1`

You continue this until you reach `depth == 0`, which is guaranteed to return a single character.

---

## 🔚 Final Thoughts:

- The tree structure helps simulate massive strings without building them
- All recursion paths eventually hit a **leaf** at `depth 0`, which gives exactly **one character**
- That one character is the **k-th** character you're looking for!
