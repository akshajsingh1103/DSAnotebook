# Understanding the DP + Binary Search Approach for the Event Scheduling Problem

[Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-events-that-can-be-attended-ii/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2025-07-08)

## Problem Restatement

You have a list of events, each with a start day, end day, and value.  
You want to attend **at most k** events, without overlapping them, and maximize the total value.

---

## Your Initial Confusion & Pain Points

### 1. What does `dp[i][j]` mean?

- `dp[i][j]` represents the **maximum total value achievable** by considering the first `i` events and attending **at most j events**.
- The events are processed in a certain sorted order (by end time).
- This setup lets us build solutions incrementally, event by event, and event count by event count.

### 2. Why loop `j` from 1 to k for each event `i`?

- For every event `i`, you want to consider all possibilities of attending from 1 to `k` events.
- This is because attending event `i` might be your 1st event, or 2nd event, ..., or kth event.
- The DP keeps track of maximum values for each count of events attended, so you must update all relevant counts `j`.

### 3. What does "last event" mean, and why do we need it?

- When deciding to attend event `i`, you need to make sure it doesn’t overlap with previously attended events.
- The "last event" refers to the **most recent event (with index less than i)** that ends before event `i` starts.
- This is crucial because you can only attend event `i` if it starts **after** the last attended event ends.
- To efficiently find this last compatible event, we do a **binary search** on events sorted by end time.

### 4. Why can’t we just keep track of one "last event" for `k-1`?

- Because the DP tracks solutions for all numbers of attended events from 0 to `k`.
- For example, attending event `i` might be your 2nd event, so you look at the best solution with `j-1 = 1` event attended **up to the last compatible event**.
- Different `j` represent different counts of events attended so far — you need to consider all to find the optimal.

### 5. How is binary search used here?

- Since the events are sorted by their end times, you can quickly find the last event that ends **before** the current event's start.
- This gives you the index `last` that tells you which dp row to look up for the previous best solution with one fewer event.

### 6. What was wrong in your original code?

- You sorted events by **start time**, but you must sort by **end time** for binary search on end times to work correctly.
- Without sorting by end time, your binary search on `endTimes` won’t be valid — the array isn’t sorted properly.
- The binary search condition and post-processing for `last` had off-by-one issues, which would select wrong events and cause incorrect dp values.

---

## How the DP Recurrence Works

For event `i` and number of events attended `j`, the two options are:

- **Skip event i**:  
  `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]`

- **Attend event i**:  
  Find last compatible event index `last`  
  `dp[i][j] = dp[last][j-1] + value_of_event_i`

Take the maximum of these two.

---

## Summary of Steps to Solve the Problem

1. **Sort events by end time** (ascending).

2. Extract the end times into a separate array for binary search.

3. For each event `i` from 1 to n:

   - Find the latest event `last` that ends before event `i` starts (binary search).

   - For each `j` from 1 to k:

     - Update `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[last][j-1] + value_of_event_i)`

4. The answer is `dp[n][k]`.

---

## Why This Works Efficiently

- Sorting by end time lets you binary search in `O(log n)` to find the last compatible event for each event.

- DP table dimensions are `n x k`.

- Total complexity is roughly `O(n * k * log n)`, which is feasible for constraints given.

## Your Final Code Goes Here

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxValue(vector<vector<int>>& events, int k) {
        sort(events.begin(), events.end(), [](const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b) {
            return a[1] < b[1];
        });
        int n =events.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1,vector<int>(k + 1, 0));

        vector<int> endTimes(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)endTimes[i] =events[i][1];

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i){
            int start = events[i - 1][0], end = events[i - 1][1], val = events[i - 1][2];
            int l = 0, r = i - 1;
            int last = 0;
            while (l < r){
                int m = (l + r) / 2;
                if (endTimes[m] < start) l = m + 1;
                else r = m;
            }
            if (endTimes[l] < start) last = l + 1;
            else last = l;

            for(int j = 1; j <= k; ++j){
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[last][j - 1] + val);
            }
        }
        return dp[n][k];
    }
};
```
